## Features

- **Modern CMake Configuration**: Utilizes the latest CMake practices for efficient build management.
- **Integrated Testing**: Includes a testing framework using [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for unit tests.
- **Static Analysis**: Employs tools like `clang-tidy` and `cppcheck` for code analysis and linting.
- **Continuous Integration**: Pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow for automated building and testing.
- **Code Formatting**: Enforces consistent code style with `clang-format`.
